# limes

limes authenticates users.

## Installation

    $ npm install limes

## Quick start

First you need to add a reference to limes in your application.

```javascript
var Limes = require('limes');
```

Then you can call the `Limes` constructor function to create a new limes instance. You need to specify a parameter object with the `identityProviderName` and either a `privateKey` or a `certificate`, each in `.pem` format. Optionally, you may also provide both.

```javascript
var limes = new Limes({
  identityProviderName: 'auth.example.com',
  privateKey: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'privateKey.pem')),
  certificate: fs.readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'certificate.pem'))
});
```

Please note that you have to specify the private key if you want to issue tokens and the certificate if you want to verify them.

### Issuing tokens

To issue a token call the `issueTokenFor` function and provide the subject you want to issue the token for as well as the desired payload.

```javascript
var token = limes.issueTokenFor('Jane Doe', {
  foo: 'bar'
});
```

### Verifying tokens

To verify a token call the `verifyToken` function and provide the token and a callback. As a result, it returns the decoded token.

```javascript
limes.verifyToken(token, function (err, decodedToken) {
  // ...
});
```

### Using middleware

To verify tokens there are also middlewares for Express and Socket.io. To use them call the `verifyTokenMiddlewareExpress` or `verifyTokenMiddlewareSocketIo` functions and optionally specify the payload for non-authenticated users.

```javascript
app.use(limes.verifyTokenMiddlewareExpress({
  payloadWhenAnonymous: {
    foo: 'bar'
  }
}));

io.use(limes.verifyTokenMiddlewareSocketIo({
  payloadWhenAnonymous: {
    foo: 'bar'
  }
}));
```

If a request does not provide a token, an anonymous token is issued. If a request does have an invalid token, an expired one, or one with a wrong issuer, the middleware returns a `401` respectively an error.

Otherwise, it attaches the decoded token to `req.user` respectively `socket.user`.

The Express middleware expects the token to be inside an HTTP header called `authorization` and prefixed with the term `Bearer`.

    authorization: Bearer <token>

Alternatively, you may transfer the token using the query string parameter `token`.

    GET /foo/bar?token=<token>

The Socket.io middleware expects you to emit an `authenticate` event and provide the token as well as a callback.

```javascript
socket.emit('authenticate', token, function (err) {
  // ...
});
```

## Running the build

This module can be built using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Besides running the tests, this also analyses the code. To run Grunt, go to the folder where you have installed limes and run `grunt`. You need to have [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) installed.

    $ grunt
